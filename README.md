# 📊 Python Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Statistical Insights

## 🧾 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis and applying statistical tests using Python to uncover patterns and insights related to employee attrition.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- SciPy  

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Distribution analysis of key numerical variables  
- Correlation analysis using heatmaps  
- Outlier detection using boxplots  

## 📐 Statistical Tests Applied
- T-test to compare income differences between attrition groups  
- Z-test to compare sample mean with an assumed population mean  
- Chi-square test to analyze dependency between categorical variables  

## 📌 Key Insights
- No statistically significant income difference between attrition groups (T-test)  
- Sample mean income differs significantly from the assumed benchmark (Z-test)  
- Department shows statistical association with employee attrition (Chi-square test)  
- High-income outliers represent senior or specialized roles
